* Scaler used is StandardScaler from scikit learn.
* Data pretrained on is just the 2015 Normal v0 data. You can ignore the original preprocessing and split scripts.
* If shuffling data, always use a random_state or a seed of 0.
* Test size used for splitting the attack file is 0.4, under train_test_split (scikit learn).
* Please contact Matthew if you want the saved files (ie. the .h5 model files, the model weights checkpoint files or the scaler .pkl file).
